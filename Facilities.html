<h2><a name="campus"></a>Campus</h2>

<p>WE, at Pragathi, always believe that our institutions should be spacious and located in peaceful surroundings away from the urban pollution and distractions.

While many institutions lack even the basic amenities, we have enrolled the children only after the premises were ready in all respects. All the campuses of Pragathi are well designed and built with a purpose. Along with well-planned infrastructure, Pragathi has huge playgrounds with separate facilities for various games and sports. The hostels and residential areas are within the premises yet at a reasonable distance that does not disturb the academic activities. 

At Pragathi, the location, the surroundings, the buildings, the landscape and the playgrounds, or in one word, the entire infrastructure is conducive to the mental and the physical growth of the child. </p>

AS we step into the second decade of the millennium, we believe that technology should be inter-woven into the 'teaching' process enhancing the curriculum across the various disciplines and levels.

It is an acknowledged fact that teaching through multi-sensory approach, in which all the 5 senses are tapped, will leave a lasting impact on the young minds and it will also be very teacher - student friendly.

We have procured the entire course syllabus from "Teach Next", one of the leading content providers in India, to make the classroom instruction more effective and enjoyable.

<h2><a name="computers"></a>Computer Lab</h2> 
<p>
INFORMATION Technology has become an integral part of our daily life. Vignan's Bo Tree has reacted to it positively. Students are provided with computer education right from the lower primary level. Our computer lab is well equipped with the latest high end systems and internet facility. It maintains an ideal student-machine ratio of 1:1.

Faculty assist the students to browse the internet in a filtered way, instruct them on how to gather information related to their projects besides developing an appreciation for the ever changing technology. Students are encouraged to do net surfing and web-browsing to keep themselves abreast of what is happening across the world.

The school has a well-equipped conference hall supported with LCDs, OHPs and other teaching aids for giving presentations, conducting seminars and symposia.

LATEST research indicates that a child possesses the ability to pick up language even at the age of two. English, being the acknowledged global language, a lot of thrust is laid on training students to speak and write it well. Our course books are designed to aid the children in becoming natural and proficient users of the language from an early age.

A structured language curriculum under the guidance of expert teachers has been designed for students right from 3rd standard to acquaint them with the nuances of standard English.

Considering that our students do not get adequate opportunity to speak English outside the school, we create maximum avenues at the school itself. We have appointed English teachers, who are not acquainted with the local language, so that all the classroom transaction is done only in English. This step has been found to be highly successful.

Also, our English language lab with a computer - student ratio of 1:1 provides the facility to the students to listen to the pre-recorded content of native speakers and linguistic experts which helps them to standardize their accent and pronunciation.

<h2><a name="library"></a>Library</h2>
<p><img src = "Library.JPG" alt="library" width = "300" height = "200"/> 

EXTRA curricular reading is an important and healthy habit. We, at Vignan, strive our best to inculcate this habit among the students, since we strongly believe that the creativity of the brain and the faculty of imagination are kept alive and alert by this all-important habit.

Our library has a very good collection of books on various topics and subjects, in addition to the magazines and periodicals, daily newspapers and over 3000 reference books, to suit the reading tastes of different age groups of children.

<h2><a name="lab"></a>Lab Facilities</h2> 
<p><img src = "Lab Facilities.JPG" alt="lab" width = "300" height = "200"/>
STUDY of science is incomplete without a proper appreciation of the scientific principles involved. Children from upper primary level are allowed to conduct experiments in the subjects of Biological Science, Physical Sciences, and Mathematics. This fosters an inquisitive spirit and a scientific temper among the young children.

The laboratories are well equipped with demonstrable working models and materials required for conducting individual as well as group experiments / projects.

Through the practical sessions in the lab, children learn to reason, connect ideas and think logically. By associating theories learned in the classrooms with practical applications tested in the labs, they have a scientific understanding of the phenomena around them. The mega, annual science exhibition, hosted by Vignan has won a wide acclaim from students and parents alike. This is an event the like of which many schools look forward to.

Also, every year, our students participate in the prestigious state and national level science exhibitions.

<h2><a name="sports"></a>Sports</h2> 
 
<p><img src = "tabletennis.JPG" alt="tennis" width = "400" height = "300"/>

SPORTS not only provide perfect relaxation and a break from the routine of academic work but also an opportunity for children to learn much about themselves, and indeed about life itself, from the experience of working as part of a team. So every child, not only the best or the senior most players, benefits from the coaches who are fully conversant with our instruction programme. Over twenty different activities are available, all introduced with the aim of ensuring that every pupil has the best possible chance of finding a sporting activity that he truly enjoys which he will continue even after leaving the School.

Our sprawling grounds facilitate playing Tennis, Skating, Volley Ball, Throw Ball, Basket Ball, Hockey, Karate, Tae-kwon-do, Kabbadi, Badminton, Kho-Kho, Cricket, Yoga, Shot put, Sprint, Long Jump, Disc Throw etc. We have a separate playfield for pre-primary children.

<h2><a name="arts"></a>Arts,Painting, Dance & Music</h2>
<p><img src = "art.JPG" alt="arts" width = "300" height = "200"/>

EACH one of us is 'bestowed' with a creative intelligence that for the most part remains underutilized due to other preoccupations in life. At Vignan, teachers make constant efforts to stir up that dormant creativity that lies in every child. We believe that true appreciation of art helps in the refinement of a person's sensibility and shapes him into a more humane individual. Hence, we encourage children to enroll in the student clubs and participate in activities like painting and other fine arts, soft-toy making, literary activities, gardening etc.

Painting, Art and Craft Studio allots a place for every child to work comfortably in an inspiring atmosphere besides providing him with adequate room to store his provisions required for such creative projects.

<h2><a name="hostel"></a>Hostel</h2>
<p>
WE believe that the best place for a child to be after school hours is his home. Nothing can substitute parental affection and care. However, some parents are compelled to keep their children in hostels for various reasons. For such students, Vignan provides hostel accommodation. A lot of thought is spent in designing the hostels. Our aesthetically designed hostel rooms, exclusively for girls, are well ventilated and hygienic and are real models in the proper utilisation of space.

Special care is taken for all the students after the school hours. A well designed study schedule under the guidance of the subject teachers, not of tutors, is followed during the time.
</p>

<h2><a name="food"></a>Food</h2> 
<p>
NOBODY cares like a mother when it comes to feeding a child. Nutritious food is essential for the physical and mental growth of the child. In all our hostels, tasty and nutritious food is served on time in generous quantities. We always encourage the parents on their visits to dine with their children, free of cost, to have a first hand knowledge of the quality of the food served in our hostels.

The Chairman, Staff and Administrative Officials, all share the same meal with students to ensure that quality is maintained at all times.

Students are groomed in dining etiquette, eating and sharing in groups, avoiding food wastage and so on when they sit for their meals in the common dining hall

A mineral water plant provides purified water to students. Solar heating facilities enable hygienic cooking besides providing students with hot water for bathing.
