<h1>Unique Features Of The School </h1>
<p>
The process of education is a dynamic, purposeful and socially relevant one. All that happens in the school and outside, events of the past and present are transformed into a learning experience. Curriculum is made vibrant by the active involvement of the students in project work, experiments and other assignment works. Many co-curricular activities are planned in Literary, Cultural, Sports and Games to tap, nurture and develop talents to a level of excellence, keeping the students highly motivated. The Grade Point Average is calculated for every student taking into consideration academics, literary, cultural , sports and games activities, discipline, punctuality, regularity to class, attitude towards school, teachers and fellow pupils. Inculcation of desirable values, concern for the underprivileged, and a deep spiritual culture are our guiding principles.

<p>
 Our teaching strategies and evaluation systems are constantly being evolved to meet the changing needs of the society. A genuine effort is made to inculcate a positive attitude towards the underprivileged by taking up various service-oriented programmes.
