<h3> About the School </h3>
<p> 
At Pragathi along with the pursuit of academic excellence, our thrust is on education based on values. Our endeavour is to foster the best of Indian values and cultivate a global outlook.

Pragathi's philosophy is founded on the belief that education is about fun-filled learning, enjoyable and relevant to today's world, while unleashing the creative potential of the child. Learning at our School is child-centered and growth oriented.

We aim to provide a world-class education with state-of-the-art facilities for the holistic development of the child. Our teaching methods are innovative and experimental, which in all humility, make the learning process an enlightening one, igniting the child's intellectual curiosity.

We believe that this prepares the child to face not only the challenges in academics, but also in all other spheres of life.
